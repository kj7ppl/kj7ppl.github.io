As a weekend project a couple weeks ago, I built a 20 foot portable antenna mast
that will mount on my pickup's hitch receiver. Today I decided to do a stability
test with the truck on level ground. I had previously tested the mast when the
truck wasn't level, and the mast flexed quite a bit. On level ground stability
seems much improved.

I took an old hitch ball mount and chopped the end off, leaving me with just a
piece of square tubing. I then welded a 2 foot section of quarter inch thick, 2
inch wide angle iron lengthwise to the tubing. To the interior of the angle
iron I welded a section of 1 1/2 inch Schedule 40 black iron pipe to act as
a receiver for the antenna mast. I left the threading on the bottom of the pipe
and extended it below the angle iron so I could thread a cap onto it. Normally
the antenna mast runs all the way through the receiver and rests on the ground,
but in situations where the property owner doesn't allow that, threading a cap
on the pipe allows the mast to be completely supported by the truck and hitch
receiver without touching the ground.

The mast sections are made of 1 inch schedule 40 black iron pipe. I bought 2
10-foot sections of pipe, chopped the threads off both ends, then chopped the
pipe in half for a total of 4 5-foot sections. I then took 1 foot sections of
1 1/2 inch pipe, slipped them halfway onto the top of each mast section to act
as a slip coupling, then welded the bottom of the coupling to the mast. Since
the couplings were a little loose fitting over the mast sections, I drilled a
few holes in the couplings and plug welded them to the mast to provide some
additional support.

To ensure the mast sections fit snugly in the couplings, I welded some small
beads in the bottom of each mast section and ground them down until they fit
snugly. This should keep the mast stable in windy conditions.

My welding isn't the best, and there probably are cheaper ways to obtain a
portable antenna mast, but it was a fun little project that gave me an excuse
to do some metal fab.

Now I just need to get an antenna to mount to the top of it...
